# My blobs for my devices

I got 6.1.3 OTA, 8.2-8.3 restore, update and OTA, 8.4.1 OTA, 9.0-91 restore, update and OTA for my 4S

iPad 4 is 8.4.1 OTA, 9.0-9.2 restore, update and OTA (thank god its 32bit)

5s is 9.2.1-9.3.1 only :/

3GS New Bootrom (only got the logic board left after my dad smashed it because he didn't want me to use it so much) is 4.1 restore & 6.1.3-6.1.6 restore using iFaith and it's still on the computer which is shit so I need Ubuntu USB for it

3GS old bootrom... Nah, it's untethered downgradable and it's kernel panicking all the time at boot anyways (something isn't right, so watchdog always times out)

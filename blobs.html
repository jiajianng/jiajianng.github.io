<h1>My blobs for my devices</h1>

<p>I got 6.1.3 OTA, 8.2-8.3 restore, update and OTA, 8.4.1 OTA, 9.0-91 restore, update and OTA for my 4S.</p>

<p>My second 4S (used to be my dad's, we didn't save a single blob till when 9.3 was almost out) has 6.1.3 OTA, 8.4.1 OTA and 9.2.1 & 9.3.1 restore, update and OTA.</p>

<p>iPad 4 is 8.4.1 OTA, 9.0-9.2 restore, update and OTA (thank god its 32bit).</p>

<p>5s is 9.2.1-9.3.1 only. :/</p>

<p>3GS New Bootrom (only got the logic board left after my dad smashed it because he didn't want me to use it so much) is 4.1 restore &amp; 6.1.3-6.1.6 restore using iFaith and it's still on the computer (which is shit on Windows 7 Ultimate so I need Ubuntu USB for it).</p>

<p>3GS old bootrom... Nah, it's untethered downgradable and it's kernel panicking all the time at boot anyways (something isn't right, so watchdog always times out).</p>
